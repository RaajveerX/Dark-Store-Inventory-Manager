# Dark Store Inventory Manager

## Why
- Startups in India like Zepto are offering 10-minute delivery across various metropolitan cities in India. They achieve this by leveraging the labor market and strategically placed dark stores (mini-warehouses meant for fulfilling online orders organized for speed and efficiency).
- I found out about this concept here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGpir4oUfJI&pp=ygUSbmV4dCBnZW4gdGhpbmtpam5n
- I was looking to get some experience with SAPUI5 and the MVC pattern and thought it would be interesting to build this

## Tech Stack
Backend: Serverless, event-driven using GCP Cloud Run Functions on a Node.js runtime
Frontend: SAPUI5
Database: GCP PostgreSQL
